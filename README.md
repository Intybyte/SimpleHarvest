## Simple Harvest +

This is a fork of https://github.com/DestinedToSuffer/Simple-Harvest with some additions.

### Requires Java 16

### New features / Updates
1. McMMO compatibility
2. Allow more configuration thanks to a config.yml
3. Rewrote and refactored the project to make it easier to mantain and understand
4. Added NetherWart to the list of crops that can be harvested
5. Changed the fortune calculations and now wheat won't be affected by fortune (like vanilla)

I will only implement bug fixes if needed, no new features unless I feel like it.

This plugin was forked for the server Winterfell and is now public.
